Subject: Remove incorrect width/height adjustments

In late 2016 a change which fixed some problems around window sizing
when attaching or detaching additional displays was landed, which fixed
some genuine bugs. Unfortunately it included a subtraction of 1 from the
width and height of the Chrome window. I couldn't find any discussion of
this size adjustment and I think that it was just a misunderstanding of
how window rectangles work (inclusive versus exclusive extents).

This size adjustment causes non-maximized Chrome windows to shrink every
time a monitor is added or removed. The problematic commit was found
by the bug-filer through a bisect of more than four years of Chrome
history - I'm just landing the fix that they suggested.
