Subject: Include ostream in quic_ip_address.h

Explicitly #include <ostream> in quic/platform/api/quic_ip_address.h, since std::ostream is referenced in it. In the C++ STL shipped with Visual Studio 2019, none of the headers included in quic_ip_address.h ends up including the required templates, which caused a compile error.
