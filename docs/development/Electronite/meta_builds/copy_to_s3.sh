#  Only parameter is version.  If AWS keys are not set, will do prompting.
#
# troubleshooting:
#   Got an S3 error that AWS user did not exist when entering credentials at prompts.  
#     No obvious reason for this, but found it started working by either setting or 
#     clearing ID `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=` before running script.
#
# Example `./copy_to_s3.sh v24.6.4`
