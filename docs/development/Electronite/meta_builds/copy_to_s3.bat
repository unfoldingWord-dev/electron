rem Copy electronite builds to S3 storage.  First do cd to build folder before running script. 
rem  Only parameter is version.  If AWS keys are not set, will do prompting.
rem
rem troubleshooting:
rem   Got an S3 error that AWS user did not exist when entering credentials at prompts.  
rem     No obvious reason for this, but found it started working by either setting or 
rem     clearing ID `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=` before running script.
rem
rem Example `.\copy_to_s3.bat v24.6.4 <key> <secret>`
