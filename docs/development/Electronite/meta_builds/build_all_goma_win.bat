rem Meta Build script to get sources, and then build for x64, x86, and arm64 by calling build_target_win.bat
rem     for each architecture.  The dist.zip files are stored at %DEST%
rem
rem Uses Chromium build tools.
rem
rem need to set paths before running this script.
rem     `set Path=%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.electron_build_tools\third_party\depot_tools;%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.electron_build_tools\src;%Path%`
rem
rem to troubleshoot build problems, do build logging by doing `set BUILD_EXTRAS=-vvvvv` before running
rem
rem Example `build_all_goma_win.bat electronite-v22.0.1-beta results\win\v22.0.1`
